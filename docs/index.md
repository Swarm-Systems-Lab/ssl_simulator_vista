# ssl_vista

Welcome to the documentation for **ssl_vista**!

A Qt-based visualization app"

## Overview

This project follows the **Swarm Systems Lab (SSL) Golden Path** - a standardized, battle-tested approach to Python project development that emphasizes:

- **⚡ Speed**: Lightning-fast tooling with `uv` and `ruff`
- **🔒 Quality**: Automated linting, testing, and security scanning
- **📦 Reproducibility**: Consistent environments across local dev, CI, and production
- **📚 Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs and comprehensive guides
- **🚀 Developer Experience**: One-command setup, clear task runners, and DevContainer support

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitea.lyapunov.local/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator_vista
cd ssl_vista

# One-command setup (installs uv if needed, creates .venv, installs deps)
just setup

# Run tests to verify everything works
just test

# Start coding!
uv run python -c "import ssl_vista; print('Ready to go!')"
```

**Next steps:**

## Project Philosophy

ssl_vista embraces the SSL Golden Path philosophy:

1. **Consistency Over Configuration**: Standardized tooling reduces cognitive load
2. **Automation Over Repetition**: Let CI handle quality checks automatically
3. **Developer Experience First**: Fast tools, clear documentation, easy onboarding
4. **Reproducibility Everywhere**: Identical environments from dev to production

## Common Tasks
